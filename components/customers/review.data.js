    "We teamed up with Pentest-Tools.com nearly 3 years ago and offered their great Web Vulnerability Assessment tools in our threatmap.ro platform, offering free, one-click quick scans for our user base. We absolutely loved the experience, so far :) and appreciate the great collaboration with their team and how easy it is to work with them in demanding projects such as Threatmap. Having access to a well-documented API was key for the successful integration of Threatmap and Pentest-Tools.com and the girls and guys over there delivered a great API, were prompt in answering our feedback and supporting our needs for some over-the-top custom integration requirements. We're pushing forward with new iterations of Threatmap, new use-cases and as we expand our user-base, Pentest-Tools.com remains one of the core tools we're using to push forward innovation, awareness and technology.",
